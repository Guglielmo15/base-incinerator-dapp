# 🔥 Base Incinerator

Base Incinerator is a Web3 tool that allows you to permanently burn ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 assets on the Base network.

Once burned, assets are sent to an unrecoverable smart contract and can never be retrieved.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Connect your wallet on Base.
2. Select an asset (ERC20, NFT, or ERC1155).
3. Confirm the burn transaction and pay the fixed fee.
4. Receive MAGMA points.
5. Optionally invite friends using your referral link to collect additional rewards.

Burning is **irreversible** – always double-check before confirming.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 MAGMA Points

Every burn generates MAGMA points, through the MAGMA badge users can view:

- Total MAGMA points  
- Rankings  
- Referral bonus history  
- Their personal referral link  

MAGMA points **do not have monetary value** and are purely a gamification reward.
